# News App

## Developer Notes

I followed the steps below to tackle this challenge:

### Setup Steps

Install app deps, client deps and server deps.
```
cd ~/Sites/news-app
yarn install

cd ~/Sites/news-app/client
npm install

cd ~/Sites/news-app/server
npm install
```

### Run app
```
yarn dev
```

### Preview app
http://localhost:5000/search

***

### Register Developer API Key

Register for Developer API Key here:
https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/

### Add API_KEY to .env

Then add `API_KEY` to project .env
cd ~/Sites/news-app/server
cp .env.example .env

```
NODE_ENV=development
GUARDIAN_API_KEY=myApiKey
```

### Update search.js to fetch news items
Note: I had to downgrade to version 2, as the project uses CommonJS.
```
cd ~/Sites/news-app/server
yarn add node-fetch@2
```

### Step — Update search.js to fetch news items from Guardian API
* Fetch news items from Guardian API
* Return JSON result items

### Step — Handle search results
* Handle search results
* Handle pinned articles

## Intro

This code activity is a way for you to show us your development skills -
we’re just as interested in how you think through a problem and approach
designing a solution as we are in the code that you write.

Please give this page a read through before we come back together and
chat through any questions you might have.

## Brief

The app we are building today is a proof of concept prototype towards a
news search / research tool where a user could:

- Search against one or more news sites / services for terms they are
  interested in
- Get a collated list of results, click through to read further the
  articles of interest.
- Pin or bookmark articles to read later or follow up.

We may or may not build all of this in the session and that's totally
fine. Just keep this in mind as background, to maybe help guide
decisions you might make.

For today we'll focus on a single source, the Guardian’s content API -
[https://open-platform.theguardian.com/](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/)

The app should present a text field for the user to type their search
terms, *as the user types* it should take that input and use it to
perform a search against

Given the result of that API call it should display a list of results,
grouped by the Section of the Guardian the items are found in.

### Specifics

- The application should be built in (React if you are doing the
  frontend coding challenge, an MVC framework of your preference if you
  are doing the backend coding challenge)
    - The application should not call the Guardian API directly, rather
      we'd like to see you build your own API as a proxy for the
      Guardian one
- Each item should show:
    - The Title
    - A link to the article
    - The publication date (formatted as DD/MM/YYYY).
    - A button or checkbox that allows it to be pinned.
        - Pinned items should appear below the search results, and stay
          on screen as search results change.

Use whichever libraries and frameworks that will help you get the job
done. Use any UI framework or prebuilt design system that works for you.
We might have a conversation about the choices you make, so it’s great
if you have a solid reason for them.

## What we’re looking for

- A working app pushed to your own Github account - please fork the repo
  and start with one of the branches for your chosen technology stack.
- A good idea of the decisions you have made while building this. Why
  you did it *this way* and not *that way* and what that means. What are
  you locking yourself into and what are you deferring to later. What is
  going to matter for ongoing performance, scalability, extensibility,
  robustness.

## **What we’re not looking for, as much**

- **Visual design.** Beyond a basic idea of clarity, any visual design
  touches are *entirely* optional. Some developers prefer to leave the
  design to designers, some get a kick out of making things *just so*.
  We like both kinds.
